## Setup

In order to setup development environment one should do the following:

For nvm installation checkout: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows (node.js shouldn't be installed) 
Download nvm-setup.zip from https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases and run "nvm-setup"

- `nvm install 16.10.0`
- `nvm use 16.10.0`

Keep in mind that other project that you are developing might not use these node versions.
